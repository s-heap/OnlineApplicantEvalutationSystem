    "Question Text": "Instituted in 1979 as a temporary measure to limit population growth, China’s one child policy remains in force today and is likely to continue for another decade. China’s population control policy has attracted criticism because of the manner in which it is enforced, and also because of its social repercussions. Supporters of the Chinese government’s policy consider it a necessary measure to curb extreme overpopulation, which has resulted in a reduction of an estimated 300 million people in its first twenty years. Not only is a reduced population environmentally beneficial, it also increases China’s per capita gross domestic product. The one-child policy has led to a disparate ratio of males to females – with abortion, abandonment and infanticide of female infants resulting from a cultural preference for sons. Furthermore, Draconian measures such as forced sterilization are strongly opposed by critics as a violation of human reproduction rights. The one-child policy is enforced strictly in urban areas, whereas in provincial regions fines are imposed on families with more than one child. There are also exceptions to the rules – for example, ethnic minorities. A rule also allows couples without siblings to have two children – a provision which applies to millions of sibling-free adults now of child-bearing age.\n\nChina’s one-ch  ild policy incr  eases the co  untry’s   wealth",

    "Question Text": "There are 562 federally recognized American Indian tribes, with a total of1.7 million members. Additionally, there are hundreds of groups seeking federal recognition – or sovereignty – though less than ten percent will successfully achieve this status. Federally recognised tribes have the right to self-government, and are also eligible for federal assistance programmes. Exempt from state and local jurisdiction, tribes may enforce their own laws, request tax breaks and control regulatory activities. There are however limitations to their sovereignty including, amongst others, the ability to make war and create currency. Historically, tribes were granted federal recognition through treaties or by executive order. Since 1978 however, this has been replaced by a lengthy and stringent regulatory process which requires tribes applying for federal recognition to fulfil seven criteria, such as anthropological and historical evidence. One of the complications regarding federal recognition is the legal definition of “Indian”. Previously, racial criteria, tribal records and personal affidavits were used to classify American Indians. Since the 1970s, however, there has been a shift to the use of a political definition – requiring membership in a federally recognized tribe in order to qualify for benefits, such as loans and educational grants. This definition, however, excludes many individuals of Native American heritage who are not tribal members.\n\nThere are only two exemptions to a federally recognized tribe’s powers of self-government.",

    "Question Text": "Sodium chloride, or salt, is essential for human life. Typically derived from the evaporation of sea water or the mining of rock salt deposits, salt has been used by humans for thousands of years as a food seasoning and preservative. The mineral sodium is an electrolyte – an electrically-charged ion  –  that  enables cells to carry  electrical  impulses to other cells,  for example muscle contractions. Electrolytes also regulate the body’s fluid levels. A diet deficient in salt can cause muscle cramps, neurological problems and even death. Conversely, a diet high in salt leads to an increased risk of conditions such as hypertension, heart disease and stroke. In spite of high-profile campaigns to raise awareness, salt consumption has increased by 50% in the past four decades, with the average adult ingesting more than double the amount of salt their body requires. Much of this increase can be attributed to the advent of frozen and processed foods in the mid-twentieth century. In the United States it is estimated that excessive salt consumption claims 150,000 lives and results in $24 billion of health care costs annually.  For individuals wishing to reduce their sodium intake, the answer is not simply rejecting the salt shaker; 75% of the average person’s salt consumption comes from food, such as bread, cereals, and cheese.\n\nHumans primarily use salt for food flavouring and preservation.",

    "Question Text": "The United Nations’ Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) recently reaffirmed a 1989 ban on trading ivory, despite calls from Tanzania and Zambia to lift it. Only 470,000 elephants remain in Africa today – compared to 1.3 million in 1979. While natural habitat loss was a significant factor in dwindling elephant populations, poaching for ivory was the main cause. Since the ban’s implementation, elephant populations have recovered in many African countries, but an estimated 38,000 elephants are still killed annually. CITES permitted one-off sales in 1999 and in 2008, allowing approved countries to dispose of their government stockpiles of ivory. Ivory from these sales was exported to Japan and China, where demand for carved ivory is high. Conservation groups vehemently oppose further one-off sales, because much of the ivory sold is of unknown origin. Furthermore, the sales have fuelled far-Eastern demand for ivory. In central and western African countries, where organized crime rings operate lucrative ivory smuggling operations, poaching remains rife. Those in favour of allowing one-off sales argue that elephants are no longer endangered, and that maintaining the ban will simply inflate the price of illegal ivory, making poaching more tempting. Though the CITES decision is viewed as a victory by conservationists, the African elephant’s future relies on governments’ commitment to enforcing the ban.\n\nNo legal sales of Ivory have occurred since 1989.",
